# Quzzical
## (Work in Progress)
This is the final project of Scrimba's React course and includes a Quiz hosting website wherein the user will be able to select the number, type and genre of questions coming in from an API. 

I'm currently working on it but it will take some time because I'm having my college exams this whole month. 

Open for any suggestions and ideas for this :)
